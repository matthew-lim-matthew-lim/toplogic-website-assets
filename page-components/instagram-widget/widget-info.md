### instragram-widget-v1-basic

Uses 'behold', which has a free teir limited to 6 posts.
Using this for now due to time-crunch. Need to complete MVP soon.

It is not a bad solution, but the free teir is limited ot 6 posts.

### instragram-widget-v2

Using `instafeed.js` library. Could be good.
More complex to set up obviously.
